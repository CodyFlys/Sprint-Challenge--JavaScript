// ==== Callbacks ====  

/* Step 1: Create a higher-order function
  * Create a higher-order function named consume with 3 parameters: a, b and cb
  * The first two parameters can take any argument (we can pass any value as argument)
  * The last parameter accepts a callback
  * The consume function should return the invocation of cb, passing a and b into cb as arguments
*/
let consume = function(a, b, cb){
  return cb(a, b);
}

/* Step 2: Create several functions to callback with consume();
  * Create a function named add that returns the sum of two numbers
  * Create a function named multiply that returns the product of two numbers 
  * Create a function named greeting that accepts a first and last name and returns "Hello first-name last-name, nice to meet you!"
*/
let add = function(a, b){
  return a + b;
}
let multiply = function(a, b){
  return a * b;
}
let greeting = function(first, last){
  return `Hello ${first} ${last}, nice to meet you!`
}

/* Step 3: Check your work by un-commenting the following calls to consume(): */
 console.log(consume(2, 2, add)); // 4
 console.log(consume(10, 16, multiply)); // 160
 console.log(consume("Mary", "Poppins", greeting)); // Hello Mary Poppins, nice to meet you!


// ==== Closures ==== 

// Explain in your own words why nestedfunction can access the variable internal.

// Explanation: Because of the JS being 2 pass it sets up references for where internal IS the first pass and it can use them on the 2nd pass since internal is being call inside of a function that contains internal. So it can setup that relationship between the 2 passes.

const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  };
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();
